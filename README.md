# AESIR_Mjolnir_propulsion_simulation
Flight and static fire simulations of NOx/Paraffin Hybrid Rocket

Execute Main.m to simulate
Data values are in Data.m as well as the choice of the simulation (flight or static)

System_equations.m is the function integrated in the simulation

Models are then devided in the following folders :
* Combustion (tank, injection and combustion chamber)
* Thrust (nozzle and ejection)
* Flight (drag, acceleration and speed)
